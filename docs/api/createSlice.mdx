# `createSlice`

A function that accepts an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a "slice name",
and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic.

Internally, it uses [`createAction`](./createAction.mdx) and [`createReducer`](./createReducer.mdx), so
you may also use [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) to write "mutating" immutable updates:

```ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

const initialState = { value: 0 } as CounterState

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.value++
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.value--
    },
    incrementByAmount(state, action: PayloadAction<number>) {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions
export default counterSlice.reducer
```

## Parameters

`createSlice` accepts a single configuration object parameter, with the following options:

```ts no-transpile
function createSlice({
    // A name, used in action types
    name: string,
    // The initial state for the reducer
    initialState: any,
    // An object of "case reducers". Key names will be used to generate actions.
    reducers: Object<string, ReducerFunction | ReducerAndPrepareObject>
    // A "builder callback" function used to add more reducers
    extraReducers?: ((builder: ActionReducerMapBuilder<State>) => void)
})
```

### `initialState`

The initial state value for this slice of state.

This may also be a "lazy initializer" function, which should return an initial state value when called. This will be used whenever the reducer is called with `undefined` as its state value, and is primarily useful for cases like reading initial state from `localStorage`.

### `name`

A string name for this slice of state. Generated action type constants will use this as a prefix.

### `reducers`

An object containing Redux "case reducer" functions (functions intended to handle a specific action type, equivalent
to a single case statement in a switch).

The keys in the object will be used to generate string action type constants, and these will show up in the Redux
DevTools Extension when they are dispatched. Also, if any other part of the application happens to dispatch an action
with the exact same type string, the corresponding reducer will be run. Therefore, you should give the functions
descriptive names.

This object will be passed to [`createReducer`](./createReducer.mdx), so the reducers may safely "mutate" the
state they are given.

```ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1,
  },
})
// Will handle the action type `'counter/increment'`
```

#### Customizing Generated Action Creators

If you need to customize the creation of the payload value of an action creator by means of a [`prepare callback`](./createAction.mdx#using-prepare-callbacks-to-customize-action-contents), the value of the appropriate field of the `reducers` argument object should be an object instead of a function. This object must contain two properties: `reducer` and `prepare`. The value of the `reducer` field should be the case reducer function while the value of the `prepare` field should be the prepare callback function:

```ts
import { createSlice, nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface Item {
  id: string
  text: string
}

const todosSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState: [] as Item[],
  reducers: {
    addTodo: {
      reducer: (state, action: PayloadAction<Item>) => {
        state.push(action.payload)
      },
      prepare: (text: string) => {
        const id = nanoid()
        return { payload: { id, text } }
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### The `reducers` "creator callback" notation

Alternatively, the `reducers` field can be a callback which receives a "create" object.

The main benefit of this is that you can create [async thunks](./createAsyncThunk) as part of your slice. Types are also slightly simplified for prepared reducers.

```ts title="Creator callback for reducers"
import { createSlice, nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

interface Item {
  id: string
  text: string
}

interface TodoState {
  loading: boolean
  todos: Item[]
}

const todosSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState: {
    loading: false,
    todos: [],
  } as TodoState,
  reducers: (create) => ({
    deleteTodo: create.reducer((state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.todos.splice(action.payload, 1)
    }),
    addTodo: create.preparedReducer(
      (text: string) => {
        const id = nanoid()
        return { payload: { id, text } }
      },
      // action type is inferred from prepare callback
      (state, action) => {
        state.todos.push(action.payload)
      }
    ),
    fetchTodo: create.asyncThunk(
      async (id: string, thunkApi) => {
        const res = await fetch(`myApi/todos?id=${id}`)
        return (await res.json()) as Item
      },
      {
        pending: (state) => {
          state.loading = true
        },
        rejected: (state, action) => {
          state.loading = false
        },
        fulfilled: (state, action) => {
          state.loading = false
          state.todos.push(action.payload)
        },
      }
    ),
  }),
})

export const { addTodo, deleteTodo, fetchTodo } = todosSlice.actions
```

#### Create Methods

#### `create.reducer`

A standard slice case reducer.

**Parameters**

- **reducer** The slice case reducer to use.

```ts no-transpile
create.reducer((state, action: PayloadAction<Todo>) => {
  state.todos.push(action.payload)
})
```

#### `create.preparedReducer`

A [prepared](#customizing-generated-action-creators) reducer, to customize the action creator.

**Parameters**

- **prepareAction** The [`prepare callback`](./createAction#using-prepare-callbacks-to-customize-action-contents).
- **reducer** The slice case reducer to use.

The action passed to the case reducer will be inferred from the prepare callback's return.

```ts no-transpile
create.preparedReducer(
  (text: string) => {
    const id = nanoid()
    return { payload: { id, text } }
  },
  (state, action) => {
    state.todos.push(action.payload)
  }
)
```

#### `create.asyncThunk`

Creates an async thunk instead of an action creator.

**Parameters**

- **payloadCreator** The thunk [payload creator](./createAsyncThunk#payloadcreator).
- **config** The configuration object. (optional)

The configuration object can contain case reducers for each of the [lifecycle actions](./createAsyncThunk#promise-lifecycle-actions) (`pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`).

Each case reducer will be attached to the slice's `caseReducers` object, e.g. `slice.caseReducers.fetchTodo.fulfilled`.

The configuration object can also contain [`options`](./createAsyncThunk#options).

```ts no-transpile
create.asyncThunk(
  async (id: string, thunkApi) => {
    const res = await fetch(`myApi/todos?id=${id}`)
    return (await res.json()) as Item
  },
  {
    pending: (state) => {
      state.loading = true
    },
    rejected: (state, action) => {
      state.loading = false
    },
    fulfilled: (state, action) => {
      state.loading = false
      state.todos.push(action.payload)
    },
    options: {
      idGenerator: uuid,
    },
  }
)
```

:::note

Typing for the `create.asyncThunk` works in the same way as [`createAsyncThunk`](usage/usage-with-typescript#createasyncthunk), with one key difference.

A type for `state` and/or `dispatch` _cannot_ be provided as part of the `ThunkApiConfig`, as this would cause circular types.

Instead, it is necessary to assert the type when needed.

```ts no-transpile
create.asyncThunk<Todo, string, { rejectValue: { error: string } }>(
  async (id, thunkApi) => {
    const state = thunkApi.getState() as RootState
    const dispatch = thunkApi.dispatch as AppDispatch
    throw thunkApi.rejectWithValue({
      error: 'Oh no!',
    })
  }
)
```

For common thunk API configuration options, a [`withTypes` helper](usage/usage-with-typescript#defining-a-pre-typed-createasyncthunk) is provided:

```ts no-transpile
reducers: (create) => {
  const createAThunk =
    create.asyncThunk.withTypes<{ rejectValue: { error: string } }>()

  return {
    fetchTodo: createAThunk<Todo, string>(async (id, thunkApi) => {
      throw thunkApi.rejectWithValue({
        error: 'Oh no!',
      })
    }),
    fetchTodos: createAThunk<Todo[], string>(async (id, thunkApi) => {
      throw thunkApi.rejectWithValue({
        error: 'Oh no, not again!',
      })
    }),
  }
}
```

:::

### `extraReducers`

One of the key concepts of Redux is that each slice reducer "owns" its slice of state, and that many slice reducers
can independently respond to the same action type. `extraReducers` allows `createSlice` to respond to other action types
besides the types it has generated.

As case reducers specified with `extraReducers` are meant to reference "external" actions, they will not have actions generated in `slice.actions`.

As with `reducers`, these case reducers will also be passed to `createReducer` and may "mutate" their state safely.

If two fields from `reducers` and `extraReducers` happen to end up with the same action type string,
the function from `reducers` will be used to handle that action type.

### The `extraReducers` "builder callback" notation

Similar to `createReducer`, the `extraReducers` field uses a "builder callback" notation to define handlers for specific action types, matching against a range of actions, or handling a default case. This is conceptually similar to a switch statement, but with better TS support as it can infer the action type from the provided action creator. It's particularly useful for working with actions produced by `createAction` and `createAsyncThunk`.

[examples](docblock://createSlice.ts?token=CreateSliceOptions.extraReducers)

See [the "Builder Callback Notation" section of the `createReducer` reference](./createReducer.mdx#usage-with-the-builder-callback-notation) for details on how to use `builder.addCase`, `builder.addMatcher`, and `builder.addDefault`

## Return Value

`createSlice` will return an object that looks like:

```ts no-transpile
{
    name : string,
    reducer : ReducerFunction,
    actions : Record<string, ActionCreator>,
    caseReducers: Record<string, CaseReducer>.
    getInitialState: () => State
}
```

Each function defined in the `reducers` argument will have a corresponding action creator generated using [`createAction`](./createAction.mdx)
and included in the result's `actions` field using the same function name.

The generated `reducer` function is suitable for passing to the Redux `combineReducers` function as a "slice reducer".

You may want to consider destructuring the action creators and exporting them individually, for ease of searching
for references in a larger codebase.

The functions passed to the `reducers` parameter can be accessed through the `caseReducers` return field. This can be particularly useful for testing or direct access to reducers created inline.

Result's function `getInitialState` provides access to the initial state value given to the slice. If a lazy state initializer was provided, it will be called and a fresh value returned.

> **Note**: the result object is conceptually similar to a
> ["Redux duck" code structure](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure#what-should-my-file-structure-look-like-how-should-i-group-my-action-creators-and-reducers-in-my-project-where-should-my-selectors-go).
> The actual code structure you use is up to you, but there are a couple caveats to keep in mind:
>
> - Actions are not exclusively limited to a single slice. Any part of the reducer logic can (and should!) respond
>   to any dispatched action.
> - At the same time, circular references can cause import problems. If slices A and B are defined in
>   separate files, and each file tries to import the other so it can listen to other actions, unexpected
>   behavior may occur.

## Examples

```ts
import { createSlice, createAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'

const incrementBy = createAction<number>('incrementBy')
const decrementBy = createAction<number>('decrementBy')

const counter = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: 0 as number,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => state + 1,
    decrement: (state) => state - 1,
    multiply: {
      reducer: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => state * action.payload,
      prepare: (value?: number) => ({ payload: value || 2 }), // fallback if the payload is a falsy value
    },
  },
  // "builder callback API", recommended for TypeScript users
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(incrementBy, (state, action) => {
      return state + action.payload
    })
    builder.addCase(decrementBy, (state, action) => {
      return state - action.payload
    })
  },
})

const user = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState: { name: '', age: 20 },
  reducers: {
    setUserName: (state, action) => {
      state.name = action.payload // mutate the state all you want with immer
    },
  },
  // "map object API"
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(
      counter.actions.increment,
      (
        state,
        action /* action will be inferred as "any", as the map notation does not contain type information */
      ) => {
        state.age += 1
      }
    )
  },
})

const reducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counter.reducer,
  user: user.reducer,
})

const store = createStore(reducer)

store.dispatch(counter.actions.increment())
// -> { counter: 1, user: {name : '', age: 21} }
store.dispatch(counter.actions.increment())
// -> { counter: 2, user: {name: '', age: 22} }
store.dispatch(counter.actions.multiply(3))
// -> { counter: 6, user: {name: '', age: 22} }
store.dispatch(counter.actions.multiply())
// -> { counter: 12, user: {name: '', age: 22} }
console.log(`${counter.actions.decrement}`)
// -> "counter/decrement"
store.dispatch(user.actions.setUserName('eric'))
// -> { counter: 12, user: { name: 'eric', age: 22} }
```
